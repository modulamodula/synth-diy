# Project Name

##### What is this?

<couple of sentences about what the schematics etc. are>

##### How much power does it use?

(eg.) As measured by the joranalogue Test 3, around x mA on +12v and y mA on -12v at peak. The 5v rail is unused.

##### Where does the design come from?

<notes about the source, including original schematic>

##### Are there any rare/weird parts used?

<Well, are there?>

##### Are there any problems with the design?

<Deviations from source schematic, odd parts etc.>

##### Do you have a BOM/Mouser cart/Tayda links?

Sorry, no. Things go out of stock so frequently it'd be a lot of work to keep these up to date. Everything in this project is easy to source though, so you should not have any trouble.

##### Can I buy PCBs or a kit?

Send me an email (twigathy+synth@gmail.com)...

(Add some rendered images of the panel and back of PCB(s).)
